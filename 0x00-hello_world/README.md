# Basic steps in C
 - In task_0, preprocessor, the compiler runs a C file ($CFILE) and saves the output in a new file named c. The compiler is gcc.
 - The task is to compile a C file that does not link. i.e if a c file is `main.c` the output should be `main.o`. The extension of the original file is `.c`, but after compilation, it should be `.o`.
